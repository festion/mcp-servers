# BLE Garage Door System - Task 1.4 Complete Implementation

## Task Overview
Successfully implemented complete BLE garage door automation system to fix missing/unavailable entities:
- `sensor.ble_mac_address_validation_status` - **FIXED** 
- `sensor.driveway_cars_present_2` → `sensor.driveway_cars_present` - **IMPLEMENTED**
- Car presence detection system - **IMPLEMENTED**
- BLE validation and management - **IMPLEMENTED**

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`packages/ble_garage_door.yaml`** - Complete rebuild with new entity structure
2. **`dashboards/ble_garage_door_dashboard.yaml`** - Updated dashboard matching new entities

### New Entity Structure
```yaml
# Input Helpers
input_text:
  - car1_mac_address (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:F1)
  - car2_mac_address (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:F2) 
  - car3_mac_address (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:F3)

input_number:
  - ble_car1_rssi_threshold (-70 dBm)
  - ble_car2_rssi_threshold (-70 dBm)
  - ble_car3_rssi_threshold (-70 dBm)

input_boolean:
  - ble_garage_automation (enabled)
  - car1_garage_access (enabled)
  - car2_garage_access (enabled)
  - car3_garage_access (enabled)
```

### Core Sensors Implemented
```yaml
# System Health Sensors
sensor.ble_mac_address_validation_status:
  - unique_id: ble_mac_address_validation_status_fixed
  - States: no_devices_configured, partially_configured, fully_configured
  - Validates MAC address format with regex pattern

sensor.ble_system_configuration_completeness:
  - States: complete, partial, incomplete
  - Checks MAC validation + proxy device count

sensor.ble_proxy_device_count:
  - Counts BLE proxy devices across all domains
  - Searches for 'ble.*proxy' pattern

# Car Presence Detection
binary_sensor.car_1_present:
binary_sensor.car_2_present:
binary_sensor.car_3_present:
  - unique_id: car1_present, car2_present, car3_present
  - Maps MAC address to device_tracker entities
  - Device class: presence

sensor.driveway_cars_present:
  - unique_id: driveway_cars_present_fixed
  - Counts cars present in driveway
  - Attributes: individual car status, cars_detected list

sensor.driveway_cars_count:
  - Numeric count of cars present
  - Unit: "cars"
```

### Automation System
```yaml
# Garage Door Automation
automation.ble_garage_door_open_on_arrival:
  - Trigger: Car presence state change to 'on'
  - Conditions: automation enabled, garage closed, car has access
  - Action: Open garage, send notification, turn on light

automation.ble_garage_door_close_on_departure:
  - Trigger: No cars present for 10 minutes
  - Conditions: automation enabled, garage open, daytime hours
  - Action: Close garage, send notification

automation.ble_system_health_check:
  - Trigger: Daily at 12:00 PM
  - Action: System status notification (disabled by default)
```

### Management Scripts
```yaml
script.ble_system_diagnostic:
  - Creates persistent notification with full system status
  - Shows configuration, car presence, proxy devices

script.test_garage_automation:
  - Tests garage door open/close cycle
  - Safety check for closed state before testing

script.refresh_ble_devices:
  - Updates all BLE-related entities
  - Sends refresh notification
```

### Dashboard Structure
- **System Status**: Health monitoring and configuration status
- **Car Detection**: Real-time car presence indicators  
- **Configuration**: MAC address and threshold settings
- **Garage Control**: Door control and access permissions
- **Quick Actions**: Test, refresh, diagnostic buttons
- **History**: 24-hour car presence timeline

## Key Features

### Smart MAC Address Validation
- Regex pattern validation: `[0-9a-fA-F:]{17}`
- Placeholder MAC detection (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:Fx)
- Progressive configuration support (1-3 cars)
- Real MAC vs placeholder differentiation

### Car Presence Logic
- MAC to device_tracker entity mapping
- RSSI threshold-based presence detection
- Individual car access permissions
- Driveway-only vs street car distinction

### Safety Features
- Manual override capability
- Time-based restrictions (6 AM - 11 PM)
- 10-minute departure delay
- Individual car access controls
- System health monitoring

### Production Readiness
- Placeholder MAC addresses for initial testing
- Graceful degradation when devices unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling in templates
- SDLC compliance (no direct production changes)

## Entity Mapping for Watchman
Original missing entities → New implementations:
- `sensor.ble_mac_address_validation_status` → `sensor.ble_mac_address_validation_status` (fixed unique_id)
- `sensor.driveway_cars_present_2` → `sensor.driveway_cars_present` (new implementation)
- `device_tracker.xiao_ble_proxy1_7276` → Handled by proxy device count system
- Car detection entities → `binary_sensor.car_1_present`, etc.

## Testing Strategy
1. YAML syntax validation ✅
2. Package structure verification ✅
3. Dashboard entity references ✅
4. Template logic validation ✅

## Next Steps for Production
1. Update real car Bluetooth MAC addresses
2. Configure ESP32 BLE proxy devices
3. Test RSSI thresholds at various distances
4. Enable system health monitoring
5. Adjust timing parameters based on usage patterns
