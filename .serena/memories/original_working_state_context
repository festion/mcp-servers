# ORIGINAL WORKING STATE DOCUMENTATION
# Date: June 3, 2025 - Preserve what was working

## SYSTEM STATE BEFORE SERENA PROJECT
- Health: 90%+ (confirmed working)
- Templates: 100% functional, no security errors
- Automations: All working properly
- No recurring template errors in logs

## CURRENT BROKEN STATE
- Health: Stuck at 85% max
- Templates: Security errors with list.append()
- Multiple redesign attempts failed
- User losing progress in redesign/fix cycles

## WHAT NOT TO DO
- Do NOT redesign existing functionality
- Do NOT create new template versions
- Do NOT add new features
- Do NOT change working template logic

## WHAT TO DO
- ONLY fix SecurityError lines
- ONLY replace list.append() with safe alternatives
- PRESERVE all existing template names and functionality
- MINIMAL surgical changes only
- Test each change before deployment

## KEY PRINCIPLE
If it was working before, preserve that exact functionality - only fix the security syntax errors.
