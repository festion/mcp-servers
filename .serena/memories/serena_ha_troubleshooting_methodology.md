# Serena-Orchestrated Home Assistant Troubleshooting Methodology

## Strategic Approach Framework

### Core Principles
1. **Serena as Central Hub**: All operations coordinated through Serena's project management
2. **Multi-Server Orchestration**: Leverage network-mcp, hass-mcp, and filesystem in coordinated workflows
3. **Staged Development**: Use c:\working for testing before network-mcp deployment
4. **Memory-Driven Learning**: Capture all patterns and solutions for future reference
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Always backup before changes, test thoroughly, maintain rollback capability

### Phase 1 Critical Issue Resolution Methodology

#### Error Analysis Strategy
1. **Log Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring error signatures and frequency
2. **Memory Cross-Reference**: Compare with known resolved issues to avoid regression
3. **Impact Assessment**: Prioritize by system stability impact and user experience
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Trace errors to configuration source via network-mcp

#### Multi-Server Coordination Pattern
```
Serena (Central Hub)
├── hass-mcp: Live system monitoring and error log analysis
├── network-mcp: Direct Home Assistant source access and configuration
├── filesystem: Staging environment in c:\working for testing
└── Memory System: Pattern storage and solution tracking
```

#### Phase 1 Execution Workflow
1. **Analysis Phase** (Serena + hass-mcp)
   - Extract specific failing entity references from error log
   - Cross-reference with system overview to identify working alternatives
   - Document exact automation and sensor dependencies

2. **Source Investigation** (Serena + network-mcp)
   - Access Home Assistant configuration files directly
   - Examine automation YAML for problematic entity references
   - Identify exact lines causing forced update failures

3. **Solution Development** (Serena + filesystem)
   - Create corrected configuration in c:\working staging
   - Implement fixes using known working sensor patterns
   - Validate YAML syntax and entity references

4. **Testing & Validation** (Serena + hass-mcp)
   - Deploy test configuration to staging area
   - Validate sensor availability before production deployment
   - Verify automation logic with corrected entity references

5. **Production Deployment** (Serena + network-mcp)
   - Backup existing configuration
   - Deploy corrected files with atomic operations
   - Monitor system for immediate error resolution
   - Rollback capability maintained throughout

#### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Backup First**: Always create configuration backup before changes
- **Incremental Deployment**: Fix one automation at a time for isolated testing
- **Monitoring**: Real-time error log monitoring during deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Immediate revert capability if issues arise
- **Documentation**: Update memory with successful patterns and failed approaches

#### Success Metrics
- **Error Reduction**: Eliminate recurring "Entity not found" warnings
- **System Health**: Restore functional health monitoring automation
- **Performance**: Reduce log noise and system resource consumption
- **Stability**: Maintain 0 failed automations status during remediation

#### Knowledge Capture Pattern
- **Successful Fixes**: Document working entity references and patterns
- **Failed Attempts**: Record what doesn't work to prevent future issues
- **Configuration Patterns**: Capture reusable automation structures
- **Testing Procedures**: Document validation steps for future use

This methodology ensures systematic, safe, and documented resolution of critical Home Assistant issues while building institutional knowledge for future troubleshooting.
