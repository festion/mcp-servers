# Development Overview

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
Our development ecosystem consists of multiple specialized repositories:
- MCP server implementations
- Home automation projects
- Infrastructure management tools
- Development templates and utilities

### Standardized Workflows
All repositories follow consistent patterns for:
- Issue tracking and project management
- Code review and testing procedures
- Documentation and release processes
- Quality assurance and deployment

## Git Workflows
