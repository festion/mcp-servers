# Prompt 01: Architecture Design Document

## Task
Create a comprehensive technical architecture document for a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner implementation that will solve CI/CD deployment issues for Home Assistant infrastructure.

## Context
- GitHub's hosted runners cannot access private network infrastructure (192.168.1.155)
- Home Assistant CI/CD pipeline is failing at SSH connection step
- Need production-ready, fault-tolerant solution

## Requirements
Create `/home/dev/workspace/github-actions-runner/ARCHITECTURE.md` with:

1. **Architecture Overview**
   - Container-based deployment strategy
   - Network connectivity requirements
   - Security isolation principles

2. **Component Design**
   - GitHub Actions runner container
   - Network bridge configuration
   - Health monitoring system
   - Backup and recovery mechanisms

3. **Technical Decisions**
   - Container orchestration (Docker Compose)
   - Service isolation strategy
   - Resource allocation requirements
   - Network security model

4. **Integration Points**
   - Home Assistant deployment pipeline
   - Existing homelab-gitops-auditor infrastructure
   - Monitoring and alerting systems

5. **Scalability Considerations**
   - Multi-runner support
   - Resource scaling strategy
   - Performance optimization

## Deliverables
- Complete ARCHITECTURE.md file
- Technical diagrams (ASCII art acceptable)
- Decision rationale for each architectural choice
- Integration specifications with existing infrastructure

## Success Criteria
- Document provides clear technical roadmap
- All architectural decisions are justified
- Integration points are well-defined
- Security and fault-tolerance requirements are addressed
