# Prompt 05: Monitoring and Health Check System

## Task
Implement a comprehensive monitoring system for the GitHub Actions runner with health checks, metrics collection, and alerting capabilities.

## Context
- Integration with existing homelab-gitops-auditor infrastructure
- Need for proactive monitoring and alerting
- Performance metrics and capacity planning
- Fault detection and auto-recovery mechanisms

## Requirements
Create monitoring infrastructure in `/home/dev/workspace/github-actions-runner/monitoring/`:

1. **Health Check System**
   - Container health monitoring
   - GitHub API connectivity checks
   - Private network reachability tests
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Service dependency checks

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - Prometheus-compatible metrics
   - Runner job execution metrics
   - System resource metrics
   - Network connectivity metrics
   - Error rate and latency tracking

3. **Alerting Configuration**
   - Critical failure alerts
   - Performance degradation warnings
   - Capacity threshold notifications
   - Integration with existing alert systems

4. **Monitoring Scripts**
   - `health-check.sh` - Comprehensive health validation
   - `metrics-collector.sh` - Custom metrics gathering
   - `alert-manager.sh` - Alert processing and routing

5. **Dashboard Configuration**
   - Grafana dashboard definitions
   - Key performance indicators
   - Historical trend analysis
   - Operational status overview

## Deliverables
- Complete monitoring configuration
- Health check scripts and automation
- Prometheus metrics configuration
- Grafana dashboard definitions
- Alert rule definitions
- Integration documentation

## Success Criteria
- All critical components are monitored
- Alerts fire before user-visible failures
- Metrics provide actionable insights
- Health checks enable auto-recovery
- Integration with existing monitoring works seamlessly
