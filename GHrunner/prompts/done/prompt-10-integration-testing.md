# Prompt 10: Integration Testing Framework

## Task
Create a comprehensive integration testing framework for the GitHub Actions runner deployment to validate functionality, performance, and integration with existing homelab infrastructure.

## Context
- Production deployment requires thorough testing
- Integration with Home Assistant CI/CD pipeline must be validated
- Need for automated and manual testing procedures
- Support for continuous integration validation

## Requirements
Create testing framework in `/home/dev/workspace/github-actions-runner/tests/`:

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Runner registration and connectivity tests
   - GitHub API integration validation
   - Private network access verification
   - Job execution and completion testing
   - Error handling and recovery validation

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Resource utilization under load
   - Network performance validation
   - Concurrent job execution testing
   - Memory and CPU stress testing
   - Scalability validation

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Home Assistant CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Homelab-gitops-auditor integration
   - Monitoring system integration
   - Backup and recovery system testing
   - Security system validation

4. **Automated Test Suite**
   - `run-tests.sh` - Test execution orchestration
   - `unit-tests.sh` - Component-level testing
   - `integration-tests.sh` - System integration validation
   - `performance-tests.sh` - Performance validation
   - `security-tests.sh` - Security validation

5. **Test Documentation**
   - Test plan documentation
   - Test result reporting
   - Failure analysis procedures
   - Regression testing guidelines
   - Continuous integration setup

## Deliverables
- Complete test suite implementation
- Test automation scripts
- Test documentation and procedures
- Performance benchmarks and baselines
- Integration validation protocols

## Success Criteria
- All critical functionality is tested
- Performance meets requirements
- Integration with existing systems works correctly
- Test suite can be automated and scheduled
- Failures are detected and reported promptly
