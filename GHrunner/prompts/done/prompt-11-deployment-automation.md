# Prompt 11: Deployment Automation System

## Task
Create a comprehensive deployment automation system for the GitHub Actions runner that enables one-command deployment, rollback, and environment management.

## Context
- Production deployment requires reliable automation
- Support for multiple deployment environments
- Integration with existing homelab automation
- Need for rollback and disaster recovery capabilities

## Requirements
Create deployment automation in `/home/dev/workspace/github-actions-runner/deploy/`:

1. **Deployment Orchestration**
   - `deploy.sh` - Main deployment orchestration
   - `pre-deploy.sh` - Pre-deployment validation
   - `post-deploy.sh` - Post-deployment verification
   - `rollback.sh` - Automated rollback procedures

2. **Environment Management**
   - Development environment deployment
   - Staging environment deployment
   - Production environment deployment
   - Environment-specific configuration management
   - Environment promotion procedures

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Terraform or equivalent for infrastructure
   - Ansible playbooks for configuration management
   - Docker Compose for container orchestration
   - Kubernetes manifests (if applicable)
   - Configuration validation and testing

4. **Continuous Deployment**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
   - Automated testing integration
   - Deployment pipeline configuration
   - Approval and gating mechanisms
   - Rollback triggers and procedures

5. **Deployment Validation**
   - Health check validation
   - Functional testing execution
   - Performance baseline validation
   - Security validation
   - Integration testing

## Deliverables
- Complete deployment automation system
- Environment management procedures
- Infrastructure as Code definitions
- Continuous deployment pipeline
- Deployment validation framework

## Success Criteria
- Deployments can be executed with single command
- Environment consistency is maintained
- Rollback procedures are tested and reliable
- Deployment pipeline is automated and monitored
- All deployments are validated and tested
