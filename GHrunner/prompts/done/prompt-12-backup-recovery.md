# Prompt 12: Backup and Recovery System

## Task
Implement a comprehensive backup and recovery system for the GitHub Actions runner deployment with automated backups, validation, and disaster recovery capabilities.

## Context
- Production system requires robust backup and recovery
- Integration with existing homelab backup infrastructure
- Need for automated backup validation and testing
- Support for disaster recovery scenarios

## Requirements
Create backup system in `/home/dev/workspace/github-actions-runner/backup/`:

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Configuration files backup
   - Runner state and data backup
   - Log files and history backup
   - Database and persistent storage backup
   - Security credentials and tokens backup

2. **Backup Automation**
   - `backup-full.sh` - Complete system backup
   - `backup-incremental.sh` - Incremental backup procedures
   - `backup-config.sh` - Configuration-only backup
   - `backup-validate.sh` - Backup integrity validation
   - `backup-schedule.sh` - Automated backup scheduling

3. **Recovery Procedures**
   - `restore-full.sh` - Complete system restoration
   - `restore-config.sh` - Configuration restoration
   - `restore-selective.sh` - Selective component restoration
   - `disaster-recovery.sh` - Emergency recovery procedures
   - `recovery-validate.sh` - Recovery validation

4. **Backup Storage**
   - Local backup storage configuration
   - Remote backup storage setup
   - Backup encryption and security
   - Backup retention policies
   - Storage optimization procedures

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Backup integrity testing
   - Recovery procedure testing
   - Disaster recovery drills
   - Backup performance monitoring
   - Recovery time objective validation

## Deliverables
- Complete backup and recovery system
- Automated backup procedures
- Recovery documentation and scripts
- Backup validation framework
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Success Criteria
- All critical data is backed up automatically
- Backup integrity is validated regularly
- Recovery procedures are tested and reliable
- Disaster recovery can be executed quickly
- Integration with existing backup systems works seamlessly
