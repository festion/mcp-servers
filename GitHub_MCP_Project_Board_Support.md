## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Language**: Go
- **API**: GitHub GraphQL API v4 (githubv4)
- **Pattern**: MCP tool registration with read/write separation
- **Testing**: Snapshot-based tool definition tests

### Key Files
- `pkg/github/projects.go` - Project board operations
- `pkg/github/project_columns.go` - Column management
- `pkg/github/project_cards.go` - Card operations
- `pkg/github/tools.go` - Tool registration

### GitHub Projects API v2 Considerations
1. **Columns as Status Fields**: In API v2, columns are represented as options in the Status field
2. **GraphQL Required**: All operations use GitHub's GraphQL API
3. **Item IDs**: Cards are referenced by item IDs, not card IDs
4. **Field Values**: Custom fields require specific mutation patterns

## Usage Examples

### Create a Sprint Board
```bash
# Create a new kanban board
mcp-cli call create_project_board '{
  "owner": "myteam",
  "name": "Sprint 23",
  "description": "Two week sprint",
  "template": "kanban"
}'

# Add columns
mcp-cli call create_project_column '{
  "board_id": "PVT_123",
  "name": "In Progress",
  "limit": 5
}'

# Add an issue
mcp-cli call add_card_to_project '{
  "board_id": "PVT_123",
  "content_id": "I_456",
  "column_id": "PVTFSC_789"
}'
```

### Bulk Operations
```bash
# Move multiple cards to Done column
mcp-cli call bulk_move_cards '{
  "card_ids": ["PVTI_1", "PVTI_2", "PVTI_3"],
  "target_column_id": "PVTFSC_999"
}'
```

## Limitations

### Current Limitations (Phase 1)
1. **Simplified Mutations**: Some write operations return simplified responses
2. **No Bulk Reads**: Bulk read operations planned for Phase 2
3. **Limited Field Support**: Custom field management coming in Phase 3
4. **Template Constraints**: GitHub API v2 has limited template support

### API Constraints
- GitHub Projects API v2 differs significantly from classic projects
- Rate limits apply to GraphQL operations
- Some features require specific GitHub plan levels

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure GitHub token has `project` scope
   - For org projects, need `read:org` scope

2. **Project Not Found**
   - Use full project ID (e.g., `PVT_kwDOAM6J184ACzDx`)
   - Check if project is accessible with token

3. **Column Operations Fail**
   - Remember columns are Status field options
   - Use field IDs, not column names

4. **Card Addition Fails**
   - Verify issue/PR exists and is accessible
   - Check project accepts the content type

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- Bulk read operations for performance
- Advanced filtering and search
- Pagination support
- Caching layer

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Custom field CRUD operations
- Automation rule management
- Webhook event handling
- Template creation
