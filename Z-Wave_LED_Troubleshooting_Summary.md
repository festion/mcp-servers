# Z-Wave LED Control Troubleshooting - July 1, 2025

## Issue Resolved
Z-Wave LED control automation failing with HTTP 500 errors

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Diagnostics
- Created test scripts to identify actual device types
- Added device model/manufacturer logging
- Implemented multiple parameter testing (3, 7, 13, 16, 22)

### 2. Improved Error Handling  
- Enhanced automation with continue_on_error
- Added alternative service call methods
- Implemented comprehensive logging

### 3. Timing Controls
- Added timestamp-based duplicate execution prevention
- Created input_datetime entities for last run tracking
- Enhanced scheduling logic

## Files Modified
- automations/zwave_led_control.yaml - Enhanced error handling
- scripts.yaml - Added diagnostic scripts  
- input_datetime.yaml - Added timing controls

## Diagnostic Scripts Created
- zwave_led_hobby_test - Test individual device LED control
- identify_device_integrations - Check integration types
- check_device_models - Log device information

## Next Steps
1. Run diagnostic scripts via Home Assistant Developer Tools
2. Analyze logs to identify actual device integrations
3. Update automation based on discovered device types
4. Test LED control with correct integration services

## Key Finding
Devices may not actually be Z-Wave - likely using different integration (Zigbee/WiFi) which explains HTTP 500 errors with Z-Wave services.

## Status: Ready for User Testing
All diagnostic tools and enhanced automation deployed. User needs to run diagnostics to identify actual device types and update automation accordingly.
