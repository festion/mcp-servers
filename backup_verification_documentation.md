## Verification Process

### Daily Operations
1. **06:00** - Basic backup integrity verification
2. **06:30** - Quality assurance checks
3. **Continuous** - Monitoring and alerting

### Weekly Operations
1. **Sunday 03:00** - Comprehensive restore testing

### Verification Workflow
1. **File Integrity**: Check backup file format and compression
2. **Metadata Validation**: Verify backup size, timestamps, and accessibility
3. **Storage Health**: Monitor storage capacity and availability
4. **Restore Testing**: Perform actual restore operations
5. **Completeness Check**: Ensure all running VMs have recent backups

## Configuration

### Storage Configuration
- **Primary Storage**: TrueNas_NVMe
- **Secondary Storage**: Backups  
- **Default Verification Period**: 7 days
- **Retention Warning Threshold**: 120 days

### Alert Configuration
- **Email Alerts**: admin@example.com
- **Alert Triggers**: 
  - Backup verification failures
  - Restore test failures
  - Missing backups for running VMs
  - Storage accessibility issues
  - Critical storage capacity (>90%)

### Test Configuration
- **Test VM ID Range**: 9990-9999
- **Sample Size**: 3 random backups per storage
- **Test Storage**: local
- **Timeout Settings**: Configurable per test type

## Log Files and Reports

### Log Locations
- `/var/log/backup-verification.log` - Integrity check logs
- `/var/log/backup-restore-test.log` - Restore test logs  
- `/var/log/backup-qa.log` - Quality assurance logs
- `/var/log/backup-verification-report.log` - Daily verification reports
- `/var/log/backup-qa-report.log` - QA summary reports

### Log Rotation
- Standard syslog rotation applies
- Logs retained for 30 days by default
- Critical alerts logged to system journal

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Proxmox VE environment
- SSH access with root privileges
- `jq` package installed
- Mail system configured (optional)

### Installation Steps

1. **Copy Scripts to Server:**
```bash
scp *.sh root@proxmox-server:/usr/local/bin/
```

2. **Set Permissions:**
```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/{verify-backups,backup-restore-test,backup-qa,backup-verification-dashboard}.sh
```

3. **Configure Cron Jobs:**
```bash
crontab -e
# Add the following lines:
0 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/verify-backups.sh
0 3 * * 0 /usr/local/bin/backup-restore-test.sh  
30 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup-qa.sh
```

4. **Create Log Directories:**
```bash
touch /var/log/{backup-verification,backup-restore-test,backup-qa}.log
chmod 644 /var/log/backup-*.log
```

## Management Commands

### Verification Operations
```bash
# Run basic verification
/usr/local/bin/verify-backups.sh --days 7

# Run verification with restore testing
/usr/local/bin/verify-backups.sh --restore-test

# Run QA check
/usr/local/bin/backup-qa.sh

# View dashboard
/usr/local/bin/backup-verification-dashboard.sh
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check recent verification results
tail -f /var/log/backup-verification.log

# View QA summary
tail -20 /var/log/backup-qa.log | grep -E "OK:|WARNING:|ERROR:"

# Monitor dashboard in real-time
watch -n 60 /usr/local/bin/backup-verification-dashboard.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Script Permission Denied**
```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup-*.sh
```

**2. Storage Not Accessible**
- Check NFS mount status
- Verify storage configuration in Proxmox
- Check network connectivity

**3. Backup Verification Failures**
- Check backup file permissions
- Verify storage space availability
- Review backup job configuration

**4. Restore Test Failures**
- Ensure test VM IDs are available
- Check storage space for test VMs
- Verify backup file integrity

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Count verification results
grep -c "SUCCESS\|ERROR" /var/log/backup-verification.log

# Find recent failures
grep "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" /var/log/backup-verification.log | grep ERROR

# Check storage issues
grep "Storage.*ERROR" /var/log/backup-qa.log
```

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **CPU Impact**: Low during normal operations
- **Storage I/O**: Moderate during verification
- **Network Usage**: Minimal for NFS storage
- **Memory Usage**: Low footprint

### Optimization Tips
- Schedule intensive operations during off-peak hours
- Adjust verification frequency based on backup schedule
- Use random sampling for large backup sets
- Monitor storage performance during verification

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Scripts require root privileges on Proxmox host
- Log files readable by root and backup operators
- Email alerts contain sensitive system information

### Data Protection
- No backup data is modified during verification
- Test VMs use temporary storage only
- Verification logs may contain system paths

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Trail
- All verification activities logged with timestamps
- Comprehensive reports generated daily
- Failed verifications automatically alerted

### Compliance Benefits
- Validates backup integrity for disaster recovery
- Demonstrates due diligence in data protection
- Provides evidence of backup testing procedures

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Integration with monitoring systems (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Advanced restore testing scenarios
- Automated backup quality scoring
- Cloud storage verification support

### Customization Options
- Configurable verification algorithms
- Custom alert thresholds
- Extended reporting formats
- Integration APIs
