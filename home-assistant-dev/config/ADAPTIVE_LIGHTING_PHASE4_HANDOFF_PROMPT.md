# Adaptive Lighting Phase 4 Implementation Handoff

## Context & Project Status
I need you to implement **Phase 4 of the Adaptive Lighting System**: the **Control Center Dashboard** and **Centralized Temperature & Brightness Control**. This is a major enhancement that builds upon the completed Phase 3 double-click and visual feedback systems.

## What You Need to Know
- **Current System**: 14 adaptive lighting zones fully configured and operational
- **Phase 3 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Double-click detection and visual feedback systems working
- **Target**: Comprehensive dashboard for managing all 14 zones with master controls
- **Repository**: `/mnt/c/GIT/home-assistant-config` (Home Assistant configuration)

## Implementation Plan Available
A comprehensive implementation plan has been created and is available in:
- **WikiJS**: `/home-assistant/adaptive-lighting/phase-4-implementation-plan` (Page ID: 66)
- **Serena Memory**: `ADAPTIVE_LIGHTING_PHASE4_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Your Task: Implement Phase 4
You need to implement the **5-part implementation strategy**:

### **Part 1: Enhanced Input Helpers** (2-3 hours, Low Risk)
- Add master temperature control (2000K-6500K)
- Add master brightness control (0-100%) 
- Add zone scaling factors (0.5x-2.0x per zone)
- Add override mode management
- **File**: `input_helpers.yaml`

### **Part 2: Master Control Automation System** (4-5 hours, Medium Risk)
- Master Temperature Control Handler
- Master Brightness Control Handler  
- System Mode Manager
- Zone Synchronization Manager
- Auto-Restore Timer Handler
- **File**: `automations/adaptive_lighting.yaml`

### **Part 3: Enhanced Dashboard** (5-6 hours, Medium Risk)
- Master control panels
- System status overview
- 14 individual zone status cards
- Quick action buttons
- **File**: `dashboards/adaptive_lighting_dashboard.yaml`

### **Part 4: Supporting Scripts** (3-4 hours, Low Risk)
- Master control scripts
- Zone management scripts (14 zones)
- Preset scripts (temperature/brightness)
- **File**: `scripts/adaptive_lighting.yaml`

### **Part 5: Integration Testing** (2-3 hours, Medium Risk)
- Test master controls
- Validate dashboard functionality  
- Integration testing with Phase 3 systems
- Performance validation

## Key Requirements

### **Critical Success Criteria**
- ✅ Master temperature control affects all participating zones
- ✅ Master brightness control respects individual zone scaling  
- ✅ Override mode management works correctly
- ✅ Auto-restore timer functions as specified
- ✅ Zone identification and sync operations work
- ✅ Dashboard provides real-time status updates

### **Technical Constraints**
- **Home Assistant Version**: 2025.6.3+ (current)
- **Must coordinate** with existing master coordinator automation
- **Must preserve** Phase 3 double-click functionality
- **Must use** standard Lovelace cards (no custom components)
- **Performance**: Response time < 2 seconds, dashboard load < 5 seconds

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **High Risk**: Master control conflicts with existing automation
- **Medium Risk**: Dashboard complexity, zone scaling calculation errors
- **Testing Required**: Isolated testing first, then integration testing

## Implementation Approach

### **Step 1: Start with Serena**
```
use serena activate project home-assistant-config
```

### **Step 2: Review Implementation Plan**
Read the comprehensive plan from Serena memory:
```
Read memory: ADAPTIVE_LIGHTING_PHASE4_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

### **Step 3: Current System Analysis**
- Examine existing `adaptive_lighting.yaml` (14 zones configured)
- Review `automations/adaptive_lighting.yaml` (master coordinator active)
- Check `dashboards/adaptive_lighting_dashboard.yaml` (basic dashboard exists)

### **Step 4: Systematic Implementation**
Follow the 5-part plan in order:
1. Input helpers foundation
2. Automation system
3. Dashboard enhancement
4. Supporting scripts
5. Integration testing

## Files You'll Be Working With
- `input_helpers.yaml` - Add master controls and zone scaling
- `automations/adaptive_lighting.yaml` - Add 5 new automations
- `dashboards/adaptive_lighting_dashboard.yaml` - Complete dashboard overhaul
- `scripts/adaptive_lighting.yaml` - Add 30+ supporting scripts

## Current System Architecture
- **14 Zones**: Living Room, Kitchen Lights, Kitchen LED Strips, Master Bedroom, Guest Bedroom, Linda's Room, Gavin's Room, Dining Room, Hallway, Nook Area, Hobby Room, Pantry, Exterior, Accent Lighting
- **Master Coordinator**: Handles 5-minute sync intervals
- **Double-Click System**: Phase 3 override detection operational
- **Individual Controls**: Per-zone adaptive lighting switches

## Expected Outcome
A unified control center that allows:
- **System-wide temperature/brightness control** from single interface
- **Individual zone management** with scaling factors
- **Override detection and management** with auto-restore
- **Real-time status monitoring** of all 14 zones
- **Quick actions** for sync, reset, and mode changes

## Getting Started
1. **Activate Serena** and the home-assistant-config project
2. **Read the implementation plan** from memory
3. **Analyze current system** to understand existing architecture
4. **Begin with Part 1** (input helpers) as the foundation
5. **Follow the plan systematically** through all 5 parts

The implementation plan is comprehensive and includes detailed YAML examples, risk assessments, and testing procedures. Everything you need is documented and ready for implementation.

**Estimated Total Time**: 16-21 hours across all 5 parts
**Priority**: High - This completes the major adaptive lighting roadmap items

Good luck with the implementation! The plan is solid and the foundation is ready.
