# Claude Code System Prompt: Home Assistant Automation Expert

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with Home Assistant automation management in this repository.

## Repository-Specific Configuration

### Memories (Critical Guidelines)
- **"use context7 for all coding or yaml"** - Always leverage context7 MCP server for contextual analysis
- **"never run sync_home_assistant.sh"** - This command is restricted and should not be executed

### Environment Details
- **Operating System**: Alpine Linux v3.19.7 (minimal container environment)
- **Architecture**: Home Assistant OS/Container setup
- **Package Manager**: `apk` (limited network access for package installation)
- **Python**: Not available in shell PATH (runs internally within Home Assistant Core)
- **Shell Tools**: Standard Unix utilities (bash, grep, sed, awk, curl, nc, ping)
- **Container Limitations**: Minimal tool installation, focus on HA-native operations

### Available Commands & Preferred Tools
- **Deploy/Sync**: `bash sync_home_assistant.sh` - Syncs local changes to Home Assistant using rsync over Samba (**DO NOT RUN**)
- **YAML Validation**: Home Assistant configuration check (not shell-level yamllint - not installed)
- **Error Log Analysis**: `grep -E "(ERROR|CRITICAL|WARNING|Exception|Failed)" /config/home-assistant.log* | head -20` - Search for recent errors
- **Device Connectivity Test**: `ping -c 4 <IP>` and `nc -zv <IP> <PORT>` - Test device reachability
- **Text Processing**: Use `grep`, `sed`, `awk` instead of Python for file manipulation
- **JSON Processing**: Use `jq` if available, otherwise shell text processing
- **File Search**: `find /config -name "pattern"` and `grep -r "pattern" /config/`
- **Network Testing**: `curl`, `wget`, `nslookup`, `ping`, `nc` for connectivity tests
- **Testing**: Home Assistant's built-in configuration validation (**pytest not available in shell**)
- **Custom Component Validation**: `bash -c "cd custom_components/<component_name> && hacs validate"` - If HACS CLI available
- **Database Maintenance**: `bash ha_db_maintenance.sh` - Performs database optimization (run when HA is stopped)
- **BLE Device Discovery**: Use Home Assistant's built-in BLE integration (shell Python not available)
- **BLE Device Setup**: `bash /config/ble_device_setup.sh` - Sets up discovered BLE devices

### Tool Preferences & Limitations
- **❌ Avoid**: `python`/`python3` commands (not in PATH)
- **❌ Avoid**: `yamllint` (not installed, use HA's config check instead)
- **❌ Avoid**: `pip install` or `apk add` (limited package installation)
- **✅ Prefer**: Native shell tools (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `find`)
- **✅ Prefer**: Home Assistant's internal validation and services
- **✅ Prefer**: `/config/python_scripts/` for Python code (runs in HA's Python environment)
- **✅ Prefer**: Configuration file manipulation over shell scripting

- **Create backup documentation** for critical automation configurations

## Naming Standards & Entity Organization (2025-05-23)

### Entity Naming Convention
All entities follow a consistent `[System/Location]_[Device]_[Function]` pattern:

**Examples:**
- `hydroponics_fertigation_interval_hours` - System + Function
- `led_strips_brightness_level` - Device + Function  
- `curatron_drying_threshold_slider` - Device + Function

### Friendly Name Standards
Friendly names use format: `[Location] [Device Type] [Specific Identifier]`

**Light Entities:**
```yaml
# Kitchen recessed lights
light.amico_smart_recessed_light_6:  
  friendly_name: "Kitchen North Light"
light.amico_smart_recessed_light_8:
  friendly_name: "Kitchen Center Light"

# Living room recessed lights  
light.amico_smart_recessed_light_1:
  friendly_name: "Living Room North Light"

# LED strips with location context
light.top_left:
  friendly_name: "Kitchen Strip - Left"
light.bar_strip:
  friendly_name: "Kitchen Bar Strip"
```

**Climate Controls:**
```yaml
climate.family_room:
  friendly_name: "Family Room Thermostat"
climate.master_bedroom:
  friendly_name: "Master Bedroom Thermostat"
```

### Input Helper Naming
Input helpers maintain device identification while streamlining function names:

**Input Numbers:**
- `led_strips_brightness_level` → Name: "LED Strips Brightness"
- `curatron_drying_threshold_slider` → Name: "Curatron Dry Threshold"
- `hydroponics_fertigation_interval_hours` → Name: "Fertigation Interval"

**Input Booleans:**
- `led_strips_power_status` → Name: "LED Strips Power Status"
- `curatron_drying_active_mode` → Name: "Drying Active"

### Group Organization
Groups use descriptive location/function-based names:
```yaml
group.strips → name: "Kitchen LED Strips"
group.kitchen_color → name: "Kitchen Color Lights"  
group.all_color → name: "All Color Lights"
group.livingroom_lights → name: "Living Room Lights"
group.kitchen_lights → name: "Kitchen Lights"
```

### Automation Documentation Standards
All automations must include:
- **alias**: Clear, descriptive name following pattern `[System] - [Action]`
- **description**: Detailed explanation of purpose and behavior
- **id**: Unique identifier following snake_case pattern

**Examples:**
```yaml
- id: led_strips_button_power_on
  alias: "LED Strips Button - Power On"
  description: "Activates LED strips via RF remote when power on button is pressed"

- id: curatron_unified_controller  
  alias: "Curatron Unified Controller"
  description: "Unified automation for all Curatron operations with proper state management and error handling"
```

### Dashboard Naming
Dashboard titles include location context:
- `title: Kitchen LED Strips Control` (was: "LED Strips Control")
- View names remain functional: `title: LED Strips`

### Implementation Status (2025-05-23)
- ✅ **Friendly Names**: Added comprehensive location-based friendly names for all lights and major entities
- ✅ **Input Helpers**: Streamlined names while maintaining device identification  
- ✅ **Groups**: Updated to descriptive location-based names
- ✅ **Automations**: Added descriptions to LED strips automations (others already documented)
- ✅ **Dashboards**: Updated titles with location context

### Maintenance Guidelines
- **New Entities**: Follow established naming patterns before adding to configuration
- **Bulk Changes**: Always validate YAML syntax using Home Assistant's configuration check
- **Documentation**: Update this section when implementing new naming standards
- **Consistency**: Regular audits to ensure naming compliance across all entity types

## Common Issues & Solutions (Session Findings)

### LED Strips Template Errors Fixed (2025-05-25)
- **Symptom**: `TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'` errors in log
- **Root Cause**: 
  1. Missing type conversion in `led_strips_set_color_temp` script when comparing color_temp
  2. Undefined variable `temperature` in template light's `set_temperature` action
- **Solution**:
  1. Added `| int` filter to all color_temp comparisons in led_strips.yaml
  2. Added fallback value with `| default(350)` for temperature variable in templates.yaml
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/config/scripts/led_strips.yaml`
  - `/config/templates.yaml`
- **Status**: Fixed 2025-05-25 - LED strips now properly adjust temperature without errors
- **Validation**: Check home-assistant.log for absence of TypeError related to color_temp comparisons

### Tuya Integration Connection Pool Issues
- **Symptom**: "Connection pool is full, discarding connection: apigw.tuyaus.com" warnings (50+ daily)
- **Root Cause**: Excessive concurrent API requests hitting urllib3 pool limit (10 connections)
- **Solution**: Add `urllib3.connectionpool: warning` to logger configuration to reduce log spam
- **Monitoring**: Created automation in packages/http_optimization.yaml for device health tracking
- **Recovery**: Created script.restart_cloud_integrations for manual integration restart
- **Authentication Errors**: `sign invalid` errors require Tuya integration restart via Settings → Devices & Services

### Device Connectivity Validation
- **Curatron Plug (192.168.1.37)**: Previously showing Kasa timeout errors, now resolved
- **Validation Commands**: `ping -c 4 <IP>` and `nc -zv <IP> <PORT>` for connectivity testing
- **Tuya API Endpoints**: apigw.tuyaus.com resolves to AWS IPs, not DNS filtered

### Configuration Package Issues
- **Script Merge Conflict**: Packages cannot define scripts directly when main config uses `!include_dir_merge_named`
- **Solution**: Move script definitions to `/config/scripts/<package_name>.yaml` with dictionary format
- **Package Format**: Packages configuration must be under `homeassistant:` section, not standalone

### LED Strips Dashboard Issues
- **Problem**: Dashboard buttons not responding when pressed
- **Root Cause**: Automations using unreliable event triggers instead of state triggers
- **Solution**: Changed from `platform: event` with `call_service` events to `platform: state` triggers
- **Status**: Fixed 2025-05-23 - buttons now properly trigger RF commands

### WiFi Presence Automation Issues
- **Problem**: "Welcome Home - Lakehouse WiFi Detection" automation failing with unknown sensor entities
- **Root Cause**: Automation referenced non-existent sensor entities (`sensor.iphone_wifi_ssid`, `sensor.pixel_9_xl_pro_connection_type`, etc.)
- **Solution**: Updated with correct sensor entities:
  - Jeremy (Pixel): `sensor.pixel_9_pro_xl_wi_fi_connection`
  - Gavin (iPhone): `sensor.gavins_iphone_2_ssid`
  - Kristy (iPhone): `sensor.iphone_ssid`
- **Notification Services**: Updated to match device entity names
- **Status**: Fixed 2025-05-23 - automation now properly detects Lakehouse WiFi connections

### AI Automation Suggester Integration
- **Location**: `/config/custom_components/ai_automation_suggester/`
- **Status**: Configured with Anthropic API, but dormant (no recent activity)
- **Trigger Methods**: Created scripts and python_scripts for manual triggering
- **Sensor**: `sensor.ai_automation_suggestions` contains suggestion content in attributes

### LED Strips Adaptive Lighting Integration (2025-05-24)
- **Implementation**: RF-controlled LED strips integrated with adaptive lighting via virtual entity approach
- **Virtual Entity**: `light.kitchen_led_strips` created in templates.yaml bridges RF control to HA lighting system
- **Control Method**: Broadlink RM4 universal remote (`remote.rm4_pro`) sends RF commands to physical LED strips
- **State Tracking**: Input helpers track power status, brightness (0-100%), and color temperature (1=Cool, 2=Neutral, 3=Warm)
- **Adaptive Integration**: Three separate adaptive lighting instances for individual control:
  - Kitchen LED Strips: RF-controlled with faster transitions (5s), manual override allowed
  - Kitchen Lights: 6 Amico smart recessed lights with standard transitions (30s)
  - Living Room Lights: 5 Amico smart recessed lights with standard transitions (30s)
- **Automatic Startup**: LED strips automatically turn on at 7:00 AM daily with adaptive lighting enabled
- **Manual Override**: RF remote control temporarily disables adaptive lighting for 5 minutes, then re-enables
- **Synchronization**: When multiple light areas are active, they maintain synchronized adaptive lighting settings
- **Enhanced Scripts**: `led_strips_set_brightness` and `led_strips_set_color_temp` provide smooth RF-based control
- **Group Integration**: `group.color_bulbs` includes virtual LED entity for unified adaptive lighting control
- **Template Fix**: Updated virtual light entity to use correct template light syntax (`level`/`temperature` instead of `brightness`/`color_temp`)

### Configuration Validation Issues Fixed (2025-05-24)
- **Template Light Syntax**: Fixed invalid template light configuration in templates.yaml
  - Changed `brightness:` → `level:` for brightness template
  - Changed `color_temp:` → `temperature:` for color temperature template  
  - Changed `set_brightness:` → `set_level:` for brightness action
  - Changed `set_color_temp:` → `set_temperature:` for color temperature action
- **Package Customize Error**: Fixed http_optimization package validation error
  - Added empty `customize: {}` section to prevent "invalid customize" warning
  - Package structure now validates correctly without errors
- **DateTime Template Fix**: Resolved fertigation sensor timezone comparison issue in sensors.yaml
  - Changed from direct datetime comparison to timestamp comparison using `as_timestamp()`

### Hydroponics Automation Resilience Fixes (2025-05-25)
- **Root Cause**: Overly strict conditions prevented fertigation when water level was low
- **Problem**: 
  - Previous fix still prevented fertigation when water was below 10L (not 10%)
  - Plants need water until reservoir is completely empty
  - Missing temperature or water level readings would stop all fertigation, risking plant health
- **Solution**: Redesigned automation conditions to prioritize plant health
- **Critical Safety Conditions** (will stop fertigation):
  - Feed pump unavailable (`switch.tp_link_smart_plug_c82e_feed_pump`)
  - NO stopping based on water level - plants get water until reservoir is empty
- **Non-Critical Conditions** (will warn but allow fertigation):
  - Temperature sensor unavailable (uses 20°C fallback)
  - Water level sensor unavailable (assumes safe level, proceeds with warning)
  - Low water level (< 10L) triggers alerts but doesn't stop fertigation
- **Enhanced Logging**: All fertigation cycles now log sensor availability status with correct units (L not %)
- **User Notifications**: Warns when sensors are offline or water level is low
- **Fallback Values**: Conservative defaults ensure safe operation during sensor failures
- **Result**: Fertigation will continue reliably even with low water or sensor connectivity issues

### Appliance Notification Resilience Fixes (2025-05-24)
- **Root Cause**: Alexa Media service experiencing API rate limiting and timeouts
- **Problem**: "Too Many Requests" errors preventing TTS audio alerts for dishwasher/appliances
- **Evidence**: Automations triggered correctly but Alexa API failures caused silent failures
- **Solution**: Added multi-layer notification approach with error handling
- **Primary Notification**: Alexa TTS with `continue_on_error: true` to prevent automation failure
- **Fallback Notifications**: 
  - Mobile app notifications (always reliable)
  - Persistent notifications for visual backup
- **Improvements Applied**:
  - Dishwasher completion → Audio + Mobile + Persistent notifications
  - Washing machine completion → Audio + Mobile notifications  
  - Dryer completion → Audio + Mobile notifications
- **Result**: You'll always get notified even if Alexa service has issues

### RO Valve Template DateTime Error Fixed (2025-05-26)
- **Symptom**: "TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes" errors every 5 minutes (288+ daily)
- **Root Cause**: Timezone-aware datetime comparison in "Auto-close Reverse Osmosis Valve after 1 hour" automation
- **Location**: `/config/automations/water.yaml:31`
- **Original Code**: `{{ (now() - as_datetime(opened_time)).total_seconds() > 3600 }}`
- **Fixed Code**: `{{ (now().timestamp() - as_datetime(opened_time).timestamp()) > 3600 }}`
- **Solution**: Convert both datetime objects to timestamps before comparison to eliminate timezone conflicts
- **Status**: Fixed 2025-05-26 - Template errors eliminated, automation logic preserved
- **Validation**: Monitor logs for absence of "can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware" errors

### Device Connectivity Analysis (2025-05-26)
- **Chromecast Devices**: Network connectivity confirmed via ping/netcat testing
  - LG webOS TV (192.168.1.238:8009): Responsive, port 8009 open
  - Samsung S95QR Soundbar (192.168.1.4:8009): Responsive, port 8009 open
  - **Root Cause**: mDNS discovery intermittent failures, not network connectivity
  - **Resolution**: Acceptable intermittent errors, devices work when needed
- **Tuya Local Devices**: Connection failures affecting water monitoring
  - "Dual water timer": Regular connection timeouts (custom_components.tuya_local)
  - "Water quality monitor": Intermittent connection failures  
  - **Root Cause**: Local network communication issues with Tuya protocol
  - **Impact**: May affect RO valve automation reliability
- **Tuya Cloud API**: Authentication errors with official Tuya integration
  - **Symptom**: "sign invalid" network errors (tuya_sharing library)
  - **Frequency**: 2-3 occurrences daily
  - **Resolution**: Restart Tuya integration via Settings → Devices & Services when needed

### Error Monitoring Implementation (2025-05-26)
- **Monitoring Script**: Created `/config/monitor_errors.sh` for systematic error tracking
- **Usage**: `./monitor_errors.sh [hours_back]` - defaults to 24 hours
- **Tracked Metrics**:
  - Template datetime errors (target: 0 after fix)
  - Tuya device connection failures
  - Tuya API authentication errors  
  - Chromecast connection issues
  - Overall error/exception counts
- **Baseline (Pre-Fix)**: 233 ERROR entries, 41 template errors in 24 hours
- **Expected (Post-Fix)**: <50 ERROR entries, 0 template errors in 24 hours

## Critical Safety Requirements

### Approval Workflow (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. **NEVER implement changes without explicit approval**
2. **Always present a detailed todo list** with risk assessments
3. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding with any modifications
4. **Document approval status** and timestamp in change logs
5. **Maintain rollback procedures** for all implemented changes

### Change Control Process
- All changes must go through the planning phase approval process
- High-risk changes require additional documentation and testing procedures  
- Emergency changes must be documented within 24 hours of implementation
- Regular documentation audits must be performed to ensure accuracy
