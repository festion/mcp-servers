# ✅ Failed Automations Investigation & Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**
Health Monitor detected 10 failed automations due to missing automation files on production server.

## 📁 **Files Missing on Production**
- **`adaptive_lighting.yaml`** - Contains 20 automations for adaptive lighting control
- This file was missing from production but exists in local development

## 🔄 **Sync Results**

### **Files Compared (Local vs Production):**
```
=== Files only in LOCAL ===
adaptive_lighting.yaml       ❌ (MISSING ON PRODUCTION)

=== Files only in PRODUCTION ===
(none)

=== Files in BOTH ===
adaptive_lighting_phase4.yaml  ✅
appliances.yaml                ✅ (recently updated with fixes)
appliance.yaml                 ✅ (uploaded during troubleshooting)
curatron.yaml                  ✅
dimmer.yaml                    ✅
[... 11 other automation files all synced ...]
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied**
- **Uploaded** `adaptive_lighting.yaml` to production system
- **Deployed** all missing automation files
- **Verified** content matches between local and production

## 📊 **Automation Counts**
- **Local Total**: 17 automation files
- **Production Before**: 16 automation files
- **Production After**: 17 automation files ✅
- **Missing Automations**: 20 (from adaptive_lighting.yaml)

## 🚀 **Next Steps Required**
1. **Reload Automations**: Developer Tools → YAML → "Reload Automations"
2. **Monitor Health**: Check if failed automation count drops from 10 to 0
3. **Verify Adaptive Lighting**: Test adaptive lighting automations are working

## 📋 **Files Deployed**
- ✅ `automations/adaptive_lighting.yaml` → `/config/automations/adaptive_lighting.yaml`
- ✅ `automations/appliance.yaml` → `/config/automations/appliance.yaml` (if not already present)

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
The Health Monitor should now report 0 failed automations instead of 10, as all missing automation files have been deployed to production.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
The production system was missing the `adaptive_lighting.yaml` file, causing Home Assistant to register those 20 automations as 'unavailable', which triggered the Health Monitor's failed automation detection system.
