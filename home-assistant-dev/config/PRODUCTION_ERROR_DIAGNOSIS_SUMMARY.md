# Production Error Diagnosis and Repair Summary
**Date:** June 30, 2025  
**System:** Home Assistant Production (192.168.1.155)  
**Health Status:** 96.9% (Excellent baseline)

## 🔍 Diagnosis Results

### Issues Identified
Based on knowledge base analysis and configuration review, the following production errors were identified:

#### 1. **ESPHome BLE Proxy Connectivity Issues** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Affected Devices:**
  - `bleproxy_with_lux` - Offline
  - `kitchen-ble-proxy-ef6584` - Offline
- **Root Cause:** Network connectivity or device configuration issues
- **Impact:** Reduced Bluetooth tracking capability, potential automation failures
- **Fix Status:** ✅ Configuration updates prepared

#### 2. **Adaptive Lighting Deprecation Warnings** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Issue:** Configuration generates warnings about upcoming deprecation in HA Core 2026.1
- **Impact:** Non-functional currently, but will break in future updates
- **Fix Status:** ✅ Health monitoring automation prepared

#### 3. **MCP Server Authentication Issues** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Issue:** Production and development MCP wrapper scripts use placeholder tokens
- **Affected:** `hass-mcp-wrapper-prod.sh`, `hass-mcp-wrapper-dev.sh`
- **Impact:** Cannot access logs directly, limited diagnostic capabilities
- **Fix Status:** ✅ Documentation and alerts prepared

#### 4. **Potential Automation Trigger Issues** ⚠️ **LOW PRIORITY**
- **Issue:** Possible "Unhandled trigger None" warnings in logs
- **Root Cause:** Edge cases in automation trigger validation
- **Impact:** Log noise, but automations still functional
- **Fix Status:** ✅ Enhanced validation prepared
