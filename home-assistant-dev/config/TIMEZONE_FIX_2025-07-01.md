# Timezone Configuration Fix - July 1, 2025

## Issue Summary
Home Assistant was running in UTC timezone instead of Central Time, causing off-peak energy announcements to trigger 1 hour early (9 PM CDT instead of 10 PM CDT).

## Root Cause
Missing timezone configuration in `configuration.yaml` caused Home Assistant to default to UTC time.

## Solution Applied
Added explicit timezone configuration to both development and production environments:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  time_zone: America/Chicago
  packages: !include_dir_named packages/
```

## Files Modified
- `/config/configuration.yaml` (line 104)
- Deployed to production via SMB

## Validation
- Off-peak energy announcements should now trigger at correct 10 PM Central Time
- All automation scheduling will use Central Time (CDT/CST)

## Deployment
- ✅ Development: Updated configuration.yaml
- ✅ Production: Deployed via SMB to 192.168.1.155
- ⚠️ **Restart Required**: Home Assistant restart needed for timezone change to take effect

## Additional Error Analysis (Same Session)

### Tuya Local Device Error
- **Device**: Dual water timer
- **Status**: Single connection refresh failure at 9:06 PM
- **Impact**: Minimal - RO valve automation continues functioning
- **Action**: Monitor for frequency; restart device if persistent

### HACS Repository Warning
- **Component**: bar-card custom component
- **Status**: Repository removed from HACS (unmaintained)
- **Impact**: None - card continues working
- **Recommendation**: Consider future migration to maintained alternatives

### Apple TV Integration Warnings
- **Issue**: Protobuf version compatibility warnings (18 occurrences)
- **Status**: Expected behavior - functional impact none
- **Versions**: pyatv gencode 5.28.1 vs runtime 6.31.1
- **Action**: No action needed - warnings are cosmetic

## Next Steps
1. Restart Home Assistant to apply timezone change
2. Monitor next off-peak announcement for correct timing
3. All other errors are informational and require no immediate action
