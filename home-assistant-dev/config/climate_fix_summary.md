# Climate Optimization Plan
# Date: June 5, 2025

## ISSUE
Honeywell climate entities taking >10 seconds to update, causing:
- UI delays
- Alexa timeouts  
- System performance issues

## SOLUTION
Add to configuration.yaml:

```yaml
# Climate optimization
honeywell:
  scan_interval: 60    # Increase from 30s default
  timeout: 20          # Increase from 10s default
```

## ACTIONS
1. Add optimization config to configuration.yaml
2. Restart Honeywell integration
3. Monitor for reduced timeout warnings
4. Verify Alexa reports succeed

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- No more ">10 seconds" warnings
- Successful Alexa climate reports
- Improved UI responsiveness
