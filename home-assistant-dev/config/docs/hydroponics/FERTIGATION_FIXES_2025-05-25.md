# Hydroponics Fertigation System Fix (2025-05-25)

## Issue Identified
The hydroponics automation was incorrectly stopping fertigation cycles when the water level was below 10 liters, which was causing scheduled fertigation cycles (particularly the 9:30 AM cycle) to be skipped.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The ESPHome sensor `sensor.wroommicrousb_reservoir_current_volume` reports volume in **liters**, not percentage
2. The automation condition was checking `current_volume >= 10`, which was interpreted as:
   - "Only proceed if water level is at least 10 liters"
   - This was causing fertigation to stop with low but still usable water levels
3. For optimal plant health, fertigation should continue until the reservoir is completely empty

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Water Level Check from Fertigation Conditions
Previously, all five fertigation cycles had this condition:
```yaml
# Old condition (incorrect)
- condition: template
  value_template: "{{ not volume_available or current_volume >= 10 }}"
```

Changed to:
```yaml
# New condition (allows all fertigation)
- condition: template
  value_template: "{{ true }}"  # Always proceed with fertigation, just alert when low
```

### 2. Added Low Water Level Alerts Without Stopping Fertigation
Added a new condition block that triggers alerts when water is low but still continues fertigation:
```yaml
# Alert if water is low but continue fertigation
- if:
    - condition: template
      value_template: "{{ volume_available and current_volume < 10 }}"
  then:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_pixel_9_pro_xl
      data:
        title: "⚠️ Hydroponics Low Water"
        message: >
          Warning: Reservoir water level is low ({{ current_volume }}L).
          Fertigation will continue but please refill soon.
        data:
          channel: "hydroponics_alerts"
          tag: "hydro_low_water"
```

### 3. Fixed Unit Display in Logs
Changed log entries to show correct units (L not %):
```yaml
# Old log message (incorrect units)
Water: {% if volume_available %}{{ current_volume }}%{% else %}sensor unavailable (proceeding){% endif %}

# New log message (correct units)
Water: {% if volume_available %}{{ current_volume }}L{% else %}sensor unavailable (proceeding){% endif %}
```

## Philosophy Behind Change
1. **Plant Health Priority**: Plants need consistent watering even when reservoir is getting low
2. **Alert Not Block**: Notify about low water levels but don't prevent fertigation
3. **Correct Units**: Display correct units (liters) in logs and alerts for clarity
4. **Resilient Operation**: System continues to function even with low water levels

## Testing and Validation
To validate these changes:
1. Wait for the next scheduled fertigation cycle (9:30 AM)
2. Check logs to confirm fertigation proceeds even with low water levels
3. Verify alerts are triggered when water level is below 10 liters
4. Monitor plant health to ensure they receive adequate nutrition

## Future Improvements to Consider
1. **Add Percentage Calculation**: Create a template sensor that calculates water level percentage based on reservoir dimensions
2. **Graduated Alerts**: Set multiple thresholds (e.g., 25%, 10%, 5%) with escalating alert severity
3. **Critical Low Alert**: Create a critical alert when reservoir is nearly empty (e.g., < 2 liters)
4. **Historical Tracking**: Track water consumption rate to predict when refilling will be needed
