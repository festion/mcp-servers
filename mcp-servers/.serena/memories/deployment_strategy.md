# GitHub Template & Project Board Deployment Strategy

## Objective
Deploy standardized GitHub project management templates and project boards to all user repositories, ensuring consistent project management across the entire development ecosystem.

## Target Repositories
Based on GitHub search results, the following repositories require template deployment:

### High Priority Repositories (Active Development)
1. **festion/mcp-servers** - ✅ Already completed (labels applied, roadmap created)
2. **festion/homelab-gitops-auditor** - ✅ Already completed (full label set applied)
3. **festion/hass-ab-ble-gateway-suite** - Home Assistant integration suite
4. **festion/proxmox-agent** - Proxmox monitoring and management
5. **festion/blender** - 3D printing file editing project

### Medium Priority Repositories (Template Projects)
6. **festion/homelab-project-template** - Template repository itself
7. **festion/github-mcp-server** - Newly forked GitHub MCP server

## Deployment Components

### 1. Standard Label System
- **Priority Labels**: critical, high, medium, low
- **Type Labels**: epic, feature, bug, docs, maintenance, investigation  
- **Status Labels**: blocked, in-progress, review, needs-info, duplicate, wontfix
- **Component Labels**: Repository-specific (frontend, backend, etc.)

### 2. Project Board Templates
- **Standard Columns**: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Review, Testing, Done
- **Automation Rules**: Card movement based on issue/PR status
- **Custom Fields**: Priority, assignee, labels integration

### 3. Issue Templates
- **Epic Template**: Large features spanning multiple issues
- **Feature Template**: New functionality or enhancements
- **Bug Template**: Bug reports and fixes
- **Documentation Template**: Documentation improvements

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Label Deployment (High Priority)
- Apply standard labels to all 7 target repositories
- Create repository-specific component labels
- Validate label consistency across repositories

### Phase 2: Project Board Creation (Medium Priority)  
- Create standardized project boards for each repository
- Configure automation rules and workflows
- Set up standard column structure

### Phase 3: Issue Migration (Medium Priority)
- Migrate existing issues to use standard labels
- Organize issues into appropriate project board columns
- Create epics for major feature sets where needed

### Phase 4: Documentation & Training (Low Priority)
- Document the new project management process
- Create usage guidelines for each repository
- Train team members on new workflows

## Success Metrics
- **Coverage**: 100% of target repositories with standard labels
- **Consistency**: Uniform labeling and board structure across all repos
- **Adoption**: Active use of project boards for issue management
- **Efficiency**: Improved project tracking and workflow management
