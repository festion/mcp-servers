# Proxmox MCP Server Troubleshooting Summary

## Issue Analysis
The Proxmox MCP server connection issues were caused by:

1. **Environment Variable Mismatch**: The wrapper script expected `PROXMOX_PASSWORD` but the server uses `PROXMOX_TOKEN`
2. **Token Authentication**: The server is configured for token-based authentication but the test was looking for password authentication
3. **Capability Limitations**: The MCP server provides high-level management tools but lacks direct container shell access

## Root Cause
The Proxmox MCP server is working correctly when properly configured. The connection test passes with:
```bash
export PROXMOX_TOKEN="PVEAPIToken=root@pam!claude=b2cb00a2-f76d-442c-a3a3-d48c0896ea8a"
```

## Available MCP Tools
- `get_system_info` - Basic system information
- `get_node_status` - Node status details
- `list_virtual_machines` - VM listing and filtering
- `list_containers` - Container listing and filtering
- `run_health_assessment` - Comprehensive health checks
- `get_storage_status` - Storage analysis
- `monitor_resource_usage` - Real-time monitoring
- `manage_snapshots` - Snapshot management (list/analyze/cleanup)
- `manage_backups` - Backup management
- `optimize_storage` - Storage optimization
- `execute_maintenance` - Automated maintenance tasks
- `get_audit_report` - Comprehensive audit reports

## Missing Capabilities
The MCP server does NOT provide:
- Direct container shell access (no `pct exec` equivalent)
- Log file access from containers
- Direct command execution in containers
- SSH connectivity to containers

## Resolution Strategy
For container troubleshooting that requires log access, alternative approaches needed:
1. Use container management tools outside MCP
2. Access containers via SSH directly (requires proper key setup)
3. Use Proxmox web interface for log access
4. Consider enhancing MCP server with container execution capabilities

## MySpeed Container Issue
The MySpeed container (LXC104) shows:
- Container is running and accessible via web interface (http://192.168.1.152:5216)
- API shows empty speedtests array, indicating scheduled tests aren't running
- Cron schedule is set to run every hour (0 * * * *)
- Need alternative access method to check container logs and diagnose speed test failures
