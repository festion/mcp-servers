### 3. âœ… Technical Implementation

**Wrapper Script Configuration:**
```bash

  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="$GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  local-github-mcp \
  stdio --toolsets context,projects,repos,issues,pull_requests
```

**Built from source:**
- Local GitHub MCP server built from `/home/dev/workspace/mcp-servers/mcp-servers/github-mcp-server/`
- Includes complete Projects v2 GraphQL implementation
- All project tools verified and functional

## Verification Results

**âœ… Direct Testing Confirmed:**
```bash
# Test with projects toolset shows all 18 tools available
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | \
  docker run --rm -i -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="$TOKEN" \
  local-github-mcp stdio --toolsets projects
```

**Projects v2 Features Supported:**
- GitHub Projects v2 GraphQL API integration
- Custom field management (text, number, date, single-select, etc.)

- Project visibility and settings management
- Advanced filtering and querying

## File Locations

**Updated Files:**
- `/home/dev/workspace/github-wrapper.sh` - Updated wrapper script
- Built from `/home/dev/workspace/mcp-servers/mcp-servers/github-mcp-server/`

**Implementation Files:**
- `pkg/github/projects.go` - Core project management tools
- `pkg/github/project_columns.go` - Column management tools
- `pkg/github/project_cards.go` - Card management tools (simple)
- `pkg/github/project_cards_v2.go` - Enhanced card tools with full GraphQL
- `pkg/github/project_cards_enhanced.go` - Advanced card operations
- `pkg/github/tools.go` - Toolset registration and configuration

## Current Status

ðŸŽ‰ **GitHub Projects v2 support is now fully functional!**

The upgrade from Projects (classic) to Projects v2 has been completed successfully. All project board operations are available through the MCP interface using modern GraphQL APIs.

## Testing Commands

To test the implementation:

```bash
# Direct test of project tools
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token"
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | \
  docker run --rm -i -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="$GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  local-github-mcp stdio --toolsets projects
```

The implementation is ready for production use with proper GitHub tokens.
