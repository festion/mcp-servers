# WikiJS Reorganization Summary

## Current State
Your wiki has grown organically with documentation scattered across multiple directories. Key issues:
- Multiple MCP troubleshooting guides in different locations
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- No clear navigation hierarchy
- Duplicate content across similar documents

## Proposed Structure

### Main Categories
- **📚 Documentation** - Core technical documentation and architecture
- **🔧 Troubleshooting** - Problem resolution guides organized by technology
- **📋 Guides** - Step-by-step how-to instructions
- **📊 Reports** - Status reports, deployment summaries, audits
- **🚀 Deployment** - Deployment guides, templates, and automation
- **🏠 Home Assistant** - Smart home automation documentation
- **🐙 MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol server documentation
- **🔗 Integrations** - Third-party integrations and connections
- **📖 Reference** - Quick reference materials and indexes

### Technology-Specific Organization
Each major technology gets dedicated sections:
- MCP Servers (Network, Code Linter, Proxmox, WikiJS, GitHub)
- Home Assistant (Integrations, Automations, Devices, Z-Wave)
- GitHub Integration (Templates, Project Boards, Automation)
- Infrastructure (Proxmox, Network, Monitoring)
